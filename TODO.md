## Content

Criacao de graficos para melhor representar os dados e validar a métrica overall_score.

- [ ] Correlation plots
  - [x] Scatter plots comparing overall_score against functional correctness, efficiency, cyclomatic complexity, or other traditional metrics
  - [x] One plot per traditional metric, with points colored by model
  - [x] Demonstrate alignment of overall_score with existing measures of code quality

- [X] Box plots / Violin plots
  - [X] X-axis: Model or task difficulty category
  - [X] Y-axis: overall_score
  - [x] Show distribution and differentiation of code quality

- [x] Rank concordance plots
  - [x] Compare rankings of models/tasks by overall_score vs rankings by functional correctness or other metrics
  - [x] Highlight that overall_score captures meaningful distinctions in code

- [ ] Task-level heatmap
  - [ ] X-axis: Tasks
  - [ ] Y-axis: Models
  - [ ] Color intensity: overall_score
  - [ ] Overlay functional correctness for direct comparison

- [ ] Delta / improvement plots
  - [ ] Compare overall_score ranking with existing metrics
  - [ ] Show nuances captured by overall_score that other metrics miss
